# The Allen Lab 
The goal of our work is to identify how non-neuronal glial cells, specifically astrocytes, regulate the formation, function and stability of neuronal synapses.
Astrocytes constitute ~20% of cells in the brain and closely interact with neurons and synapses via thousands of fine processes, putting them in a position to sculpt the development of synapses and regulate ongoing synaptic transmission. As the brain progresses from early development to adulthood to aging, the properties of neurons and synapses change: from high levels of synaptogenesis and remodeling in development, to stable mature synapses in the adult brain, to synapse loss and a decline in synaptic function in aging. We aim to identify if these stage-specific properties of synapses are all intrinsic to neurons, or if the astrocytes the neurons interact with also display stage-specific properties that regulate synaptogenesis, synaptic stability and synapse loss.
